## MITx

This repo is related to projects of MITx;A machine learning course developed by MIT professors and stuff.

Contains all projects from linear models to deep learning.

## Contents
<ul>
  <li> Linear Classifiers, Regularization: Sentiment analysis</li>
  <li>  Neural Networks with Pytorch: ANNs, RNNs, CNNs</li>
  <li> Unsupervised Learning : K-Nearest, Mixture Models and EM algorithm (Gaussian Mixture Models)</li>
  <li> Reinforcement Learning: Q-Learning algorithm</li>
</ul>



## Tools

you gonna need this following packages:

numpy, matplotlib, scipy, tqdm, scikit-learn , pytorch

visit <a href="https://pytorch.org">Pytorch</a> for more installation guide depending in your OS and envs (pip or anaconda) w/ or wo/ CUDA.

# Using conda environment

Create your environment
```
  conda create -n <name of your env> python==3.9
  
```

using pip (or conda), in one go, install these packages

```
pip install numpy scipy matplotlib tqdm scikit-learn

```

# Note:

This is not a project repo, it's a rather somewhat a guide for new verified learners to slove the project problems, in case they stuck.
